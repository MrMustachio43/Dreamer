## Character Customization

 With the character customizer, you can change the shape of your face with morph targets, the colour of you skin and your hair (Head, beard, moustache, eyebrows and lashes)

An example of Changing morphs:

If you already have a character made, this changes the sliders to the correct value so that when you change them, everything is correct.

How i change the morph target:

The widget system is split up into their own sub componants. This allows for easy editing and clarity when making changes

When it comes to saving, i go through seperate fungtions which writes to a file the values of morph taregets and notes the used hair + its binding, as well as the colours used for skin/hair/eyes
